# EmployeeDetail_webpage

Employee Detail webpage to display, add and delete the details of Employee.

I have done a webpage where we can display, add and delete the details of employee. I have used SQLite3 database using Flask.

* app.py helps to connect the frontend and the backend using Flask.

* SQLite3 is used for this application since it doesn't require any installations. It creates a .db file and executes the queries.

* sql_func.py has the SQLite3 queries to connect database and execute CRUD operations.

* templates folder contain HTML and CSS files.

After downloading the folder in your local system, navigate to the respective folder and run **python app.py** in command prompt, it will show the packages to download or use an virtual environment and run **python app.py**. Cilck the link provided in the output to open the webpage.
